# Cyclose Display for Voron 2.4

This is a simple Round Display to monitor my Voron 2.4
It uses a Waveshare round display. And it is a Display only mod since I tend to do everthing through the webinterface.  So I just wanted a cool looking display that would show me the Bed/extruder temp and the print progress for when I pop into the room.

# Mod Instructions (so far):

The holder for the display is 50mm smaller then the standard display, this means you'll have to print the voron skirts that are 1 size larger (not tested yet...working on building my V2 as we speak).  I developed this for my 250mm build so I thought that this display would look beter on a small frame, it may look a bit silly on a large frame.


# Todo

This is just the beginning, I'm still in the proccess of learning Mainsail so my first step is to power the display off an ESP32, once this is done I will work on developing a Raspberry PI version and run it right off the PI.

If you have some knoledge of Moonraker or Raspberry Pi programming, drop by a line, I hang around in CanadaLand on the voron Discord (QuinFromCanada#5297).
