# Cyclose Display for Voron 2.4

This is a simple Round Display to monitor my Voron 2.4
It uses a Waveshare round display. And it is a Display only mod since I tend to do everthing through the webinterface.  So I just wanted a cool looking displayt that would show me the Bed/extruder temp and the print progress for when I pop into the room.
